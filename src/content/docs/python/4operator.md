# Operators

Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand. Let's look at the different types of operators in Python.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

| Operator | Description              | Example     |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| +        | Addition                 | `x + y`     |
| -        | Subtraction              | `x - y`     |
| *        | Multiplication           | `x * y`     |
| /        | Division                 | `x / y`     |
| %        | Modulus (remainder)      | `x % y`     |
| **       | Exponentiation (power)   | `x ** y`    |
| //       | Floor division           | `x // y`    |

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return either True or False.

| Operator | Description              | Example     |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| ==       | Equal to                 | `x == y`    |
| !=       | Not equal to             | `x != y`    |
| >        | Greater than             | `x > y`     |
| <        | Less than                | `x < y`     |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to | `x >= y`    |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    | `x <= y`    |

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

| Operator | Description              | Example             |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| and      | Logical AND              | `x > 0 and x < 10`  |
| or       | Logical OR               | `x < 5 or x > 10`   |
| not      | Logical NOT              | `not(x > 0)`        |

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

| Operator | Description              | Example     |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| =        | Assign                   | `x = 5`     |
| +=       | Add and assign           | `x += 3`    |
| -=       | Subtract and assign      | `x -= 3`    |
| *=       | Multiply and assign      | `x *= 3`    |
| /=       | Divide and assign        | `x /= 3`    |
| %=       | Modulus and assign       | `x %= 3`    |
| //=      | Floor divide and assign  | `x //= 3`   |
| **=      | Exponent and assign      | `x **= 3`   |

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to compare binary numbers.

| Operator | Description              | Example       |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| &        | AND                      | `x & y`       |
| \|       | OR                       | `x \| y`      |
| ^        | XOR                      | `x ^ y`       |
| ~        | NOT                      | `~x`          |
| <<       | Zero fill left shift     | `x << 2`      |
| >>       | Signed right shift       | `x >> 2`      |

## Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the memory location of two objects.

| Operator | Description              | Example       |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| is       | Same memory location     | `x is y`      |
| is not   | Different memory location| `x is not y`  |

## Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.

| Operator | Description              | Example       |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------|
| in       | Present in the sequence  | `'a' in x`    |
| not in   | Not present in sequence  | `'a' not in x`|
