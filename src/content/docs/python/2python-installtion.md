Before you can start programming in Python, you need to set it up on your system. Follow these steps to get Python up and running.

## Step 1: Download Python

1. Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

## Step 2: Install Python

### On Windows

1. Run the downloaded installer.
2. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
3. Click "Install Now" and follow the prompts.

### On macOS

1. Open the downloaded .pkg file.
2. Follow the prompts in the Python installer.

### On Linux

Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check if Python is installed by running:
```bash
python3 --version
```
If not installed, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
```

## Step 3: Verify Installation

Open your terminal or command prompt and type:
```bash
python --version
```
or
```bash
python3 --version
```
You should see the version number of Python that you installed.

Congratulations! Python is now installed on your system.
